Small scale image based discussion forum! Unfortunatly, this page is statically hosted and as a result does not have the dynamic elements	available.
For example the original project allowed users to create accounts, post content (including images) and vote based on what they liked. 
The website was dynamically (locally) hosted and implemented the LAMP stack runing on the Oracle virtual machine. 

This project was done from scratch, front end and backend.
